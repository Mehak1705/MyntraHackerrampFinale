#  Myntra Hackerramp Finale 

This project was created during the **Myntra Hackerramp Hackathon** with the aim of combining fashion with technology to offer a more personalized shopping experience. Instead of suggesting generic products, it focuses on individual appearance by analyzing facial features from a user-uploaded image. By detecting skin tone, hair color, and eye color, it provides tailored clothing color suggestions that enhance the userâ€™s natural look. The platform is simple, interactive and designed to make fashion choices easier, more accurate and fun for users.
